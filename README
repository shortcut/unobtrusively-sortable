Unobtrusively Sortable
======================

Create sortable lists in Rails with minimal configuration. The lists will be sortable with javascript disabled. jQuery awesomeness will be applied if javascript is enabled.

The plugin assumes that you are using the newest version of acts_as_list (TODO: Insert more about commit SHA and what not when the patch has been accepted. http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8995/tickets/55-storing-the-configuration-options-in-acts_as_list)
